# Chromium - 6.0.472.58
This project is for building chromium-6.0.472.58 with Tsan in order to test [CVE-2010-3412](http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-3412/)

The runtime of this project could be recommended for building on Ubuntu 14.04

## Build the LLVM, clang and compiler
Follow the same steps to install [LLVM-3.7.1 & clang-3.7.1 and compiler-3.7.1](https://github.com/ruigulala/ConAnalysis#install-llvm-361--clang-361).
However, you need to be attention for two significant modifications.
* Before the step of building LLVM together with Clang using CMake, you must apply a patch which disables the tsan hooks.
```compiler-rt.chromium.patch``` can be found in the source code. Patching for the folder ```compiler-rt``` under ```llvm-3.7.1.src/projects/```
```
patch -p1 < compiler-rt.chromium.patch --dry-run (to check)
patch -p1 < compiler-rt.chromium.patch (to patch)
```
* While come to the step of ```cmake ..```, you need to build with ```-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON```
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON
```
