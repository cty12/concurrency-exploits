# Chromium - 6.0.472.58
This project is for building chromium-6.0.472.58 with Tsan in order to test [CVE-2010-3412](http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-3412/)

The runtime of this project could be recommended for building on Ubuntu 14.04

## Build the LLVM, clang and compiler
Follow the same steps to install [LLVM-3.7.1 & clang-3.7.1 and compiler-3.7.1](https://github.com/ruigulala/ConAnalysis#install-llvm-361--clang-361).
However, you need to be attention for two significant modifications.
* Before the step of building LLVM together with Clang using CMake, you must apply a patch which disables the tsan hooks.
```compiler-rt.chromium.patch``` can be found in the source code. Patching for the folder ```compiler-rt``` under ```llvm-3.7.1.src/projects/```
```
patch -p1 < compiler-rt.chromium.patch --dry-run (to check)
patch -p1 < compiler-rt.chromium.patch (to patch)
```
* While come to the step of ```cmake ..```, you need to build with ```-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON```
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON
```

## Install ```depot_tools``` for using ```gclient``` to build chromium
* Check ```git``` is installed
* Clone ```depot_tools```
```
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
```
* Add depot_tools to your PATH
```
export PATH=`pwd`/depot_tools:"$PATH"
```

## Build Chromium-6.0.472.58
* Create a folder called ```chromium-6.0.472.58``` and download the ```DEPS``` file to this folder, the ```DEPS``` file can be found in the source code
```
mkdir chromium-6.0.472.58
cd chromium-6.0.472.58
```
* Generate the source code of Chromium
```
gclient sync
```
* After waiting for a few mintues, there are two folders generated one is ```chromeos``` the other is called ```src```. Download ```chromium.patch``` to current folder, and patch for the source code.
```
patch -p1 < chromium.patch --dry-run (to check)
patch -p1 < chromium.patch (to patch)
```
* Setup the environment variables
```
export CFLAGS="-no-integrated-as -fPIC -fsanitize=thread -gline-tables-only"
export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
export LDFLAGS="-pie -fsanitize=thread -gline-tables-only -Wl,--allow-multiple-definition"
export CC=/your/path/clang
export CXX=/your/path/clang++
```
* Go to ```src```
```
cd ./src
```
* Generate a executable at ```./src/out/Debug/chrome```
```
