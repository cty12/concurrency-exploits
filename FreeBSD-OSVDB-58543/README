Here are two bugs involved, you can see them on

The following reproduce process has been tested in Linux 64-bit, multi core processor.
I think other OS should also work, but multi-core processor may be indispensable.

Steps:
0. Download FreeBSD 7.2-release
wget http://ftp-archive.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD-Archive/old-releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/7.2/7.2-RELEASE-i386-disc1.iso
1. Install VMWare workstation (VirtualBox may also work)
2. Create New Virtual Machine -> Typical -> USE ISO image -> Other FreeBSD
3. Customize Hardware -> Number of processors : 4
4. Boot FreeBSD ISO, select default boot option (Note, the following steps are for FreeBSD 6.0, and it appears similar to FreeBSD 7.2)
5. Standard -> OK -> OK -> Use Entire Disk -> Finish -> Standard -> OK -> Auto Defaults -> Finish -> All -> Yes -> OK -> OK -> Yes
6. OK -> Yes -> No IPV6 -> Yes DHCP -> OK -> No.....No -> User Confirmation Requested YES! -> User -> Login ID (your username), Password (your password), Login shell (/bin/tcsh) -> OK -> Exit -> OK -> Root password -> No -> Exit Install -> Yes -> Remove the CD
7. Now the system should start, login use your normal username

FreeBSD 7.2 is built with SMP support, so you don't need to rebuild the kernel, you could run 'sysctl -a |grep ncpu' should show a number > 1

10. get and Compile the malicious code
You should change to another tty and login as a normal user
scp user@host:~/bug.c .
gcc bug.c -o bug -pthread

11. Obtain the root shell
You should login as a normal user
./bug
This bug will always succeed
You can try the following to prove that you are the root:
touch /root/evil
